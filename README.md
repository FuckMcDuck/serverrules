Basic Rules:

I.
Do not RDM on the server! (Random Death Match) This includes killing players without a legitimate reason to follow up the action with.

II.
NLR is not enforced on this server, however it is NOT allowed to return to a location during a raid, a siege, or any general attack on a settlement! It is recommended to return to neutrality once you have died to someone.

III.
Do not RevengeRDM! RevengeRDM means hunting down whoever killed you purely as revenge. If you die on the server, you cannot return and kill whoever killed you. if you feel that you have been killed by someone, against rules, or for no reason, please report this to an admin instead of killing them back.

IV.
Do not use your microphone for sounds other than your voice / a voice. Your voice needs to be as understandable as possible, and thus, the mic should not be used to play sounds or music. Exceptions can only be made if people admit that they are not bothered by it. Once you are told to stop, stop!

V.
Do not use racism and excessive foul verbal language in Advert-chat, nor in OOC. These chats are to be kept clean. Disrespecting players in a sit or in non-rp context is not okay. You can use mild racism in local chat and voice as long as it is purely mean't in an RP-context. (In other words, disallowing particular players from entering your settlement.)

VI.
Do not abuse your ability to spawn props! This includes the following:
Prop Spam, Prop Push, Prop Block, Prop Climb, Prop Minging.
Please use your toolgun and Physgun as carefully as you can! Work slowly and build slowly.
Please do only create contraptions or buildings that suit the theme. Constructions can be removed if this criteria is not met.
Additionally, only use suitable materials from the Toolgun. (ex: Wood, Stone, Metal, Dirt)

VII.
Value your life properly! Your life is most important to you, even though it might be hard to think that way in a computer-game. Do not ask people to kill you for the sake of getting your HP reset. There are plenty of ways to get your health back.
Do not suicide, unless it is in deep RP-context.

VIII.
Do not FailRP. FailRP implies you are doing something without thinking about the consequences of say... fear, and proper care of your life. The following are actions that are without doubt classified as FailRP, or FearRP on this server:

► Breaking out of restraints while kidnapped. You are instead required to get helped by another person in order to get out.
► Drawing your weapon and attempting to kill a target while already surrounded by armed players targeted on you. Especially relevant while in an opposing faction's base.

Staff members have the right to define FailRP, should it be needed because the scenario was not mentioned here.

IX.
A player cannot sit on another player unless one of the following criteria is upheld:

► Players may only sit on a dragon if the dragon in question has been legitimately persuaded/tamed into it.
► Players may sit on a Dragon if the Dragon is captured. This is only allowed for the kidnapper.

Maximum player-count sitting on another player: 1

Killing Rules:

I.
Do not kill people for annoyance, verbal language towards you, or loitering, BEFORE you tell them to stop! Once you have warned them, you may kill them. Preferably, bind a warn-advert for these situations and advert once you are in this situation. The third party must be given time to leave/step back from you.

II.
Do not kill players that have broken any rule affecting your roleplay! If you see rules being broken, report this to an admin, and do NOT fight back against them or you may get punished as well! if needed, you may restrain the troublemaker. Don't be a hero and let staff do their job for you.

III.
Do not kill specific factions/races in the Town or in your own settlement unless you have a textscreen by your entrance stating what races/factions are not allowed in. It is also recommended to advert this rule when you make it, especially as a Town Guard.

IV.
You may kill opposing faction-members entering your faction base without permission.
If you are not part of a faction while you enter their base, you may be KOSed anytime!
Do NOT kill faction-members while in their base unless you are raiding or sieging them!

V.
if you end up in a situation where you are being threatened by a third party weapon, you cannot draw your own weapon and attempt killing them! You are to listen to them until you are not in danger anymore! Value your life!

VI.
Do not kill other members of your own faction, by ANY circumstances! Even if you end up against each other at some point. You are instead required to persuade them back to your side if they were to end up on an opposing side. This is the golden rule of factions. You cannot go rogue because of this.

ZYprIuP.png
Kidnapping Rules:

I. Kidnapping is ONLY referred to when one player uses restraints on another player to potentially drag them off and manipulate them. The process of a kidnapping always needs restraints!

II. Kidnapping/Using restraints while in close-melee-combat is not allowed! If you are at "sword-point" or being threatened by a weapon of any sorts then you can not rely on restraining them in combat.

III. Kidnapping needs to be executed quickly and unnoticed in the eyes of the victim. Victims do not have to allow you to kidnap them if you show yourself standing up-front to them with restraints in your hand, even if you advert! A proper kidnap happens behind their backs, thus while they are aware of your presence, you cannot kidnap them.

IV. You are eligible to keep a victim captured for 20 minutes of time. You are also eligible to kill, torture or let the victim go during their time in restraints.

Kidnap Cooldown: 10-15 Minutes

ZYprIuP.png
Siege Rules:

I.
Sieging can only be triggered by the higher ranks of a faction, or by the General/King/Leader if there is one. Once adverted through the following command "/ad Siege", members of the faction are allowed to use props to climb the walls if the gates remain locked and there are no ways in. The props need to be still when climbed on, like any siege-ladder. Try to only use props with as much suit to the theme as possible. We recommend ladders.

Members of the faction may advert assist in conjunction with the original siege-advert, however this is not always required. Neutral parties that assist a faction MUST advert "assist"

II.
Sieging can ONLY occur between factions if the factions are at war! This is a grieve requirement and should at all times be followed. If the leader of any faction dies during a siege, the other factions remains victorious. More on this following in more rules.

III.
Sieging can only be done by factions. If a neutral association of people, which assumes anyone that isn't a faction, attempts to take a base/castle, it is considered a raid, which does not allow props to be placed for climbing over!

IV.
A siege ends if either the castle is empty, or the faction leader dies. If the faction leader is not in the faction-base while it is being sieged, the attackers also automatically win.

V.
Every player in a siege gets ONE LIFE to kill. Once you die, as either an attacker or as a defender, you are required to not participate anymore! As a defender, you are instead required to flee the castle/base by either jumping off the wall or exiting the complex. Do not use your weapons at any point after you have died. 
If you are teamkilled, you may respawn and fight once more, but only as a defender.

VI.
Once a faction-leader dies or the siege ends, the losers MUST surrender and exit the perimeters! They may not fight anymore and are considered beaten at this stage. If you re-spawn following the events of your base being taken over, you are required to flee immediately unless the new owners allow you to stay. That requires you to also serve them instead.

Siege cooldown: 20 minutes

ZYprIuP.png
Declaring Wars:

I.
Declaring wars can only be done once you have a genuine reason to do so. Under rare occasions, wars can be engaged to cause events by staff.

II.
As with sieging, only the highest authority of a faction can declare war on another faction.

III.
The declared-to-be-fought-against-faction MUST accept before a war can truly begin! Once the opposing faction accepts in advertisement, the war is on.

IV.
If a general/King/Leader dies but not while a siege is occurring, the war will remain for the next king to be voted for! The war carries over until a true siege is played out, where one of the leaders die, OR with a agreement of peace!

V.
If no leader is displayed during a war, killing the second-highest authority will end the war at ANY time.

ZYprIuP.png
Raiding Rules:

I.
Raiding gives you authority to break the owners' valuables and lockpick their doors. These actions can not be done otherwise. Raiding is only possible by certain jobs, as citizens cannot. You may also kill any opponents in the property. We recommend not raiding factions.

II.
You may not kidnap while raiding. Either you spare or you kill the opponents.

Raiding cooldown: 15 minutes (You cannot raid the same base consecutively! 2x in a row)

ZYprIuP.png
Base Construct. Rules:

I.
Bases can only have a maximum of two obstacles! (World-door + Fading Door, Fading Door x2). The doors need to have space in-between to act as a point where players can stand and lockpick without worry of time.

II.
Keypads are required by a fading door on both sides with a hold time of at least 5 seconds! You MUST use the keypad to open your fading door. You cannot use the assigned key! Otherwise it can be considered fading-door abuse.

III.
Factions may also use base-like defenses however they are limited to only use one fading door in storing valuables and NOT as to serve as another door.

IV:
Players must be able to walk/run through the base without additional input (jumping, crouching etc). This is KingdomRP, and high technology fortifications can be removed/reduced for being unsuited. It is your responsibility to use the world and yourself as primary defense. Do not use see-through-walls, and do not attack players through these walls!

Raiding and Kidnapping within the Town is always, by standards, not allowed.

Hellhounds are wild creatures, that are most commonly found in the Wilderness. Much like Dragons, Hellhounds cannot enter a kingdom or a settlements without being tamed.
Hellhounds can advert "Murder/Bloodthirst/Wildkill" in order to kill a player within the wilderness. Once they are out of the zone, the action is immediately over. Hellhounds can NOT Counter, Raid, Mug, unless they are accompanied by their owner! Hellhounds may not RDM otherwise.
